"aboutDescription": "I completed my Bachelor in Computer Science at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in 2019. Then I moved to Dallas to study for a Master of Science in Software Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas. After graduation, I landed a couple of jobs working on Flutter, the technology that I enjoy the most working on.\n\nI am also a chess Grandmaster, before coming to the US in 2015, I was a professional chess player and part of the Cuban National Chess Team. In my free time (if I am not experimenting with Flutter or playing chess) I play racquetball or watch anime.",
